# SurvivingCovid19-The Economic Fight 

### THE ECONOMIC FIGHT 

After a record-setting 2019, the US economy started off 2020 with another strong job market. In January, job gains beat expectations, wages grew above 3%, and unemployment rates remained at or near historic lows. 

Unfortunately, all of this changed drastically. We are currently living in a global pandemic, this economic crisis unleashed by the outbreak of COVID-19 is hurting economies, regardless of income level. With unemployment on the rise and state by state reopening’s; we are now in a survival mode climate.  


# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project will be based on the analysis of unemployment data in the current COVID-19 climate and the impact on single-family home pricing by region.

### SCOPE:
Utilizing Machine Learning and leveraging unemployment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), we want to analyze the impacted of the unemployment rate in New York, California, Texas and Florida and identify the correlation and prediction of single-family home sales prices.

### PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
 * Identify a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing
 * Use ML in the context of technologies learned 
 * Use Scikit-Learn: machine learning in Python

### REQUIREMENT OBJECTIVE:
Use algorithms and statistical analysis to create ML models on data and make predictions about new data without being explicitly programmed to do so.

### DATA STAGES:
   * Collect data 
   * Import data
   * Clean data 
   * Split data into train/test or cross validation sets 
   * Transform Data

# MACHINE LEARNING OVERVIEW 
Machine Learning is the study of computer programs that leverage algorithms and statistical models to learn through inference and patterns without being explicitly programed

### TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING:
   * Supervised Machine Learning - Machine learns from training data
   * Unsupervised Machine Learning - No training data is required 
   * Reinforcement Learning - Machine learns on its own 

This project will utilize Supervised Machine Learning which entails training a predictive model on historical data with predefined target answers.
